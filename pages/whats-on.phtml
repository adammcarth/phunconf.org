                        The unconference is an evening event that has no prescribed schedule.
                        Instead, the organisers (with the assistance of subject matter experts
                        and guided by community interest) run a series of open circle discussions focusing
                        on knowledge sharing and peer learning. A wide range of topics are discussed and no
                        unconf is ever the same.

                        The workshops are a focused classroom style learning experience
                        where numbers are limited for the benefit of those attending. Workshop
                        sessions are led by industry leaders including SydPHP's very own Dave
                        Clark (Zend Certified Training Partner). A full workshop schedule will be
                        announced soon and will feature topics including Web applications at
                        Scale and a PHP Masterclass.

                        their unit testing skills. Developers will complete a series of simple code
